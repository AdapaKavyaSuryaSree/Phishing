The dataset contains 10,000 rows and 50 columns.

I have one target variable.
There are no null values present in the dataset.

Models used are logistic regression, Decision tree classifier, MLP classifier, XGB classifier, Support Vector Machine, Random forest.

I have applied these models for 50 features set, correlation reduced (25 features set), correlation reduced with 90% pve (17 components), 50 features set with 90% pve(30 components), with 85% pve(26 components), 80% pve(23 components), 75% pve (21 components) and with 70% pve(18 components).

I have plotted graph for accuracy v/s no. of components for support vector machine.

I have plotted the heat map for correlationÂ matrix.
